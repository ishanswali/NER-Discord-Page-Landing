            <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
            <p>To create an inclusive, engaging, virtual community for Civil Air Patrol members.</p>

        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>The Northeast Region Discord server was envisioned by members of the 2020 Winter Northeast Region Cadet
            Leadership School Staff. The ongoing global pandemic has affected Civil Air Patrol members throughout the
            nation, and in response, these determined cadets sprung into motion and found a way to create a portal to
            humanity and connection. Through focusing on creating an inclusive, engaging, server for Civil Air Patrol
            members, we have created a vibrant, active community of cadets of all ages, experiences, and backgrounds.</p>
