    </ol>
    <p> Congratulations, you have now created a Discord account!</p>

    <h2 class="header">Managing Discord Friends List</h2>
    <p>While most Discord users interact via Discord servers, it is also possible to set up a contact list or
      <strong>Friends List</strong> on Discord. This list allows you to interact with other users via direct message and
      voice or video calls.
    </p>
    <ol class=content>
      <li>To Add a friend on Discord, click on the <strong>Add Friend</strong> button at the top of the Discord Home
        Page. </li>
      <li>Next, you will be prompted to enter a username. This username will be the <strong>DiscordTag</strong> of the
        friend you wish to add. <br><br>The DiscordTag is a username followed by a # symbol and a series of random
        numbers and can be seen on the bottom left hand corner of the Discord interface. <br><br>You can also find the
        DiscordTag by clicking on the profile picture of the user you wish to add as a friend. This will take you to
        their profile page, which will show the DiscordTag. There is also a Send Friend Request button on the profile
        page that you can click to directly send a Friend Request. </li>
      <li>Once you have entered the DiscordTag you wish to add, click Send Friend Request. </li>
      <li>After the other user has accepted your friend request, they will then show up on your friends list. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Congratulations, you now know how to add friends in Discord!&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 id="join"><strong>Joining a Discord Server</strong></h2>
    <p>As Discord communities are housed in distinct servers, you will need to find a server that suits your interests.
      Once you have located a community you&#8217;d like to participate in, you will then need to join their server. We
      will outline this process below:</p>
    <ol class=content>
      <li>Click on the <strong>Magnifying Lens</strong> symbol to start searching for servers. <br><br><a
          href=images/FindServer.png rel=lightbox-3><img loading=lazy width=298px height=134px
            class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/FindServer.png alt="Find Server"></a></li>
      <li>On the following page, type what you want to search for in the text field and press the <strong>enter</strong>
        key. In this example, we are looking for tech-centric communities with the search term &#8220;tech&#8221;.</li>
      <li>The search tool will then display a list of servers based on your search criteria. Click <strong>View</strong>
        to see the server homepage for any server that interests you.<br><br><a href=images/Search.png rel=lightbox-4><img
            loading=lazy width=298px height=134px class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/Search.png
            alt=Search></a></li>
      <li>Once you&#8217;ve found a server you want to join, click <strong>Join Server</strong> at the bottom of the
        server homepage.<br><br><a href=images/MicroSoftDiscord.png rel=lightbox-5><img loading=lazy width=298px height=134px
            class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/MicroSoftDiscord.png alt="Microsoft Discord"></a>
      </li>
      <li>The <strong>icon</strong> for the new server will now appear on the left-hand side of your Discord homepage
        for quick access.</li>
      <li>If you want to leave the server at any point, right-click on the server icon and select <strong>Leave
          Server</strong>.&nbsp;It will prompt you to confirm this decision. Click <strong>Leave Server</strong> again
        to complete the process.<br><br><a href=images/LeaveServer.png rel=lightbox-6><img loading=lazy width=298px
            height=134px class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/LeaveServer.png
            alt="Leave Server"></a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps you can add as many servers to your Discord homepage as you would like, giving you easy
      access to your favorite communities.</p>
    <h2 id="change"><strong>Changing Notification Settings</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>To make sure you never miss a moment, you may want to modify the notification settings for the servers you have
      joined. As some of the options may not be clear, we will outline and explain the process here:</p>
    <ol class=content>
      <li>Right-click on the server icon for the server you want to modify.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Notification Settings</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The first option allows you to <strong>mute</strong> the entire server. Selecting this option still allows you
        to receive a notification if someone mentions your username in one of the chat channels. This is useful if you
        donâ€™t want to be overwhelmed by notifications but still want to know when someone is trying to contact
        you.&nbsp;<br><br><a href=images/NotifSettings1.png rel=lightbox-7><img loading=lazy width=200px height=200px
            class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/NotifSettings1.png
            alt="Notification Settings 1"></a></li>
      <li>In the Notification Settings menu, choose from the following options:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>All
          Messages</strong>: You will get a notification every time a message is sent in one of the chat channels you
        have access to on the server.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Only @ Messages</strong>: You will only get a notification if
        someone tags you by typing the @ symbol before your name<br><br><strong>Nothing</strong>: You will not receive
        notifications from this server.<br><br><a href=images/NotifSettings2.png rel=lightbox-8><img loading=lazy width=200px
            height=200px class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/NotifSettings2.png
            alt="Notification Settings 2"></a></li>
      <li>Below those options are three toggles that further modify your notification settings:<br><br><strong>Suppress
          @everyone and @here</strong>: By default, Discord notifies all users in a server when someone uses the tags
        @everyone and @here. Turning this option <strong>on</strong> disables those
        notifications.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Suppress All Role @mentions:</strong> By default, Discord notifies all users
        assigned to a specific user role on a server when @UserRole is typed in one of the chat channels. Turning this
        option <strong>on</strong> disables those notifications.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Mobile Push
          Notifications:</strong> By default, Discord will forward any notifications you receive to the email address
        associated with your account. Turning this option <strong>off</strong> disables those
        notifications.&nbsp;<br><br><a href=images/NotifSettings3.png rel=lightbox-9><img loading=lazy width=200px height=200px
            class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/NotifSettings3.png
            alt="Notification Settings 3"></a></li>
      <li>At the bottom of the menu, there is also the option to override the default settings of individual channels
        instead of the entire server. To do this, you click on the <strong>drop-down menu</strong>, select the channel
        you want to override, then check the corresponding bubble for which notification setting you want to change.
        This is useful for servers that have a large number of chat channels as it allows you to filter which channels
        you receive notifications from.<br><br><a href=images/NotifSettings4.png rel=lightbox-10><img loading=lazy width=200px
            height=200px class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/NotifSettings4.png
            alt="Notification Settings 4"></a></li>
      <li>When you are finished making changes, click <strong>Done</strong> to save the changes.<br><br><a
          href=images/NotifSettings5.png rel=lightbox-11><img loading=lazy width=200px height=200px
            class="std_ss alignnone wp-image-6525 size-thumbnail" src=images/NotifSettings5.png
            alt="Notification Settings 5"></a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>After setting up your notification preferences, you should be all set to start using Discord to enhance your
      online experience and find communities that match your interests without being overwhelmed by excess
      notifications.&nbsp;<br></p>
